## System Overview

### Introduction
The Sales Management System (SMS) is a robust and scalable software solution designed to optimize and streamline the sales processes. This section provides an overview of the SMS architecture, highlighting its key objectives, components, architectural style, and data model.

### Key Objectives
The primary objectives of the Sales Management System architecture are as follows:

1. **Process Optimization:** To automate and streamline sales processes, eliminating manual, error-prone tasks, and ensuring consistent workflows.

2. **Sales Tracking:** To provide real-time tracking of sales activities, including leads, opportunities, and orders, allowing for better decision-making and forecasting.

3. **Data Centralization:** To consolidate sales-related data into a single, accessible repository, reducing data silos and facilitating data-driven insights.


### Key Components
The Sales Management System consists of the following key components:

<!-- #### User Interface (UI)
- The User Interface serves as the front-end component of the system.
- It provides a user-friendly and intuitive platform accessible through web and mobile interfaces.
- Users, including sales representatives, managers, and administrators, interact with the system through the UI. -->

#### Backend Services
- The Backend Services component is the core of the system, responsible for executing business logic and data processing.
- It handles user authentication, authorization, and session management.
- Manages data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.

#### Database
- The Database component stores structured data related to sales, products, and user profiles.
- It utilizes a relational database management system (MySQL) for data persistence.


#### Security
- The Security component implements robust security measures, including user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and data encryption.
- It monitors and logs user activities for auditing and compliance purposes.


### Architecture Style
The SMS follows a microservices architecture, enabling scalability, modularity, and maintainability. Each major component ( Backend, Database) is encapsulated within its own microservice, allowing for independent development and deployment.

### Data Model
The data model includes core entities such as User, Product, Invoice and Sales Order, which represent the fundamental data structures for managing sales-related information.
